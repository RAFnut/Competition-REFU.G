REGU-G: Helping Families Reunite
=========

During the second SICEF Hackathon we developed an application for helping refugees and won second place. The development was done in just 24 hours and the whole prototype is available:

GitHub: https://github.com/RAFnut/Competition-REFU.G
Live version: http://hakaton.rafnut.com/web/app.php/login

Our application was accessible via the web as well as SMS which allowed refugees to communicate even if Internet access is not available.

The goal of the app is to help families stay in touch, reunite and track their movement during their dangerous journey across Europe. We also use their GPS data to create an anonymous crowd-sourced map that shows the movement of refugees across the world.

Our technology stack was based around Symfony2 and JavaScript. We integrated the Nexmo SMS API, Google Maps API (with the Places API) and the Bootstrap framework.
